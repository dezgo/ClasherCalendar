ClasherCalendar
===============

Little project mostly to get going with Android app development, maybe to get a few downloads on the Play Store
Designed to track progress in Supercell's Clash of Clans. You add your toon in, tell it what town hall (th) level it's at, then the app adds in all the buildings for a toon with that TH level.

When you upgrade a building, you record it in the app, and then get reminders when stuff is ready. Also gives a handy overview of what everything costs, how long you've got to to max everything, to help with planning your base.
